History

Birgunj

Location of Birganj in Madhesh
Province

Ancient
Before the establishment of Birgunj, the main center of Parsa district was Alau
(near Dryport), Nepal. In July 1959 From Sugauli King Rajendra Bikram
Shah has a history of setting up a military camp in Alau of Parsa district.
The ancient name of Birgunj was Gahawa but the 11th Rana Prime Minister
of Nepal Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana changed it to Birgunj in 1897.
Before the establishment of Birgunj Bazar, the surrounding villages of Bagahi,
Alau, Barewa, Kalaiya, Parsauni, Inaruwa, and Chhapkaiya existed. To
establish Birgunj Bazar in a forest covered area, Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur
Rana appointed his trusted duo Siddhvir Mathema and Dhadjavir Mathema
(two brothers), respectively in Birgunj as the rulers of Mal Ada and Kath Mal
Ada. In this connection, Siddhvir Mathema distributed free land and timber
and provided cash assistance to the homeowners in Birgunj. The act
subsequently required Siddhvir Mathema to pay the death penalty.
After the death of Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, Dev Shamsher Jang
Bahadur Rana became Prime Minister, but within three months Chandra
Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana had driven Dev Shamsher and made himself
Prime Minister. The people of Late Bir Shamsher Rana and Dev Shamsher
Rana did not tolerate Chandra Shamsher Rana. Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur
Rana's special man Siddhivir Mathema, was accused of conducting an
inspection of a reservoir treaty and carrying out three lakh irregularities on his
forehead. When Siddhivir showed the calculations he had spent on setting up
Birganj Bazar, he was declared invalid and an order was issued to pay the

a punishment, the signboard was stuck on his chest and he move it around the
market. The verbal verdict of the death sentence was to cut off and kill. After
hearing about the verbal death sentence given to Mathema who worked day
and night to establish Birgunj Bazar, Late Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana's
wife has paid 3 lakh and rescued Mathema from the death penalty.

Chandra Shamsher also wanted to displace Birgunj Bazar, which his brother
had established. He wanted to remove the Birgunj bazaar from there and set it
in Rautahat. According to the move to displace the market, In 1959, it raided
the main market from Raxaul to Birgunj and extended the rail line service to
Amalekhganj. From the link, the train used to run around the houses,
exploding and terrorizing the residents. Later, the rail link was moved to the
east of the market (outside the market). The Raxaul city in India, which is
currently connected to Birgunj as the main gateway to Nepal, was not
established. At that time Indian trains operated only till Sugauli.[4]

Economy
Birgunj is the Industrial and Commercial Capital of Nepal. Birgunj Chamber of Commerce & Industries is the leading and
the oldest Chamber of Commerce & Industries in Nepal.

In 1964 when Birgunj Sugar Factory Ltd. was established by the Government of Nepal in collaboration with the Soviet
Union (at present, Russia) with initial crushing capacity of 1,000 metric tons which later increased to 1,500 metric tons
(Rajak, 2006). This was the first sugar mill established in the public sector. Later on, this mill was liquidated due to heavy
losses.
Birgunj is a major business centre of Nepal, especially for trade with India. Almost all trade with India occurs through this
route. The Indian border town of Raxaul has become one of the busiest towns for heavy transportation due to high trade
volume. With a large number of industries set on the Birgunj-Pathlaiya industrial corridor, Birgunj produces a wide range
of products such as pharmaceuticals, textiles, vegetable ghee, plastic, steel, plastic, cigarettes, aluminium, among others.
Almost 56% of the total products of Birgunj are exported to the Indian state of Bihar.[15]
Birgunj Customs holds a major contribution in terms of revenue earnings in the nation. On 16 July 2004 Birganj Inland
Dry Port came in operation to improve trade operation and address the concerns in handling the large volume of goods.
The India-Nepal oil pipeline construction that began on 9 March 2018, saw its completion up to 13 km (8.1 mi). The 69kilometre (43 mi) Amlekhgunj-Raxaul oil pipeline connecting the two countries has been laid along the Pathlaiya-SimaraJitpur, Parwanipur and Birgunj bypass roadway. According to the reports, major part of the pipeline alignment is covered in
the Birgunj-Pathlaiya commercial highway.[16]

Tourism
Birgunj is main entry to Nepal. So, the city is widely visited by the Indians. There are good three-star hotels in the main
centre of the city. These hotels operate some mini casinos as well.
During Chhath festival, Ghadiarwa Pokhari is visited by numerous people
from different parts of the country. Vishwa Buddha Vihar is another religious
place which is located in the out-skirts of the city. Vishwa is actually shaped
like a stupa and has engravings of Buddha facing the cardinal directions of
the universe. This place has a tranquil ambience and it attracts those tourists
who want to flee the bustling life of the city. The term vishwa is derived from
the word vicchu-wa, which is translated as a resting place for Bikshu(s) or
Buddhist monks and means a resting place. In the ancient times, the pilgrims
stopped at Birgunj in the midst of their journey between Lumbini and Bodh
Gaya (India). The mound is protected by a boundary wall, and future
excavations may well tell us about the history of not just Birgunj but also its
importance to Buddhism 2,500 years ago.

Parsa National Park which is 33 km (21 mi) from the city, known for inhabiting Royal Bengal Tigers (Panthera tigris
tigris), Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), One-horned Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), Common Leopard (Panthera
pardus) and also various species of mammals, birds and reptiles. The park can visited by one hour drive by bus from the
city.[17]

Transport
Birgunj was built as the closest Nepalese city connecting the capital Kathmandu with India. Birgunj railway station was
connected by the Nepal Government Railway (NGR) to Raxaul station in Bihar across the border with India. The 47 km
(29 mi) railway extended north to Amlekhganj in Nepal. It was built in 1927 by the British but discontinued beyond
Birgunj in December 1965.[18]

Rail
Trains run to major cities of India from Raxaul station (in India, adjacent to Birgunj) and Sugauli station (17 miles from
Raxaul) including the Satyagrah Express to Delhi, Mithila Express to Kolkata, Lokmanya Tilak express to Mumbai, and
HYD-RXL express to Hyderabad. Thus, Birgunj has direct connectivity to major Indian cities like – Patna, Varanasi,

Haridwar, Chandigarh, Dehradun, Allahabad, Kolkata, New Delhi, Mumbai, Bhopal, Amritsar, Guwahati, Lucknow,
Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Ranchi, Raipur, Nagpur, Hyderabad, etc. The Raxaul-Birgunj-Kathmandu railway survey report has
been ready and in coming future the further work will be started soon.

Air
Birgunj is served by Simara Airport, which lies 9 miles north of the city. Regular flights operate to Kathmandu & Pokhara,
and . The second International Airport of Nepal is under construction at Nijgadh (22 miles from Birganj). There are plans
to connect the new airport, Birgunj and Kathmandu via a "Fast track" expressway after its completion. This is expected to
reduce travel times between the capital and the commercial capital, Birgunj.

Buses
There are regular bus services to all major cities and towns in Nepal including Kathmandu, Pokhara, Patan, Bhaktapur,
Biratnagar, Dharan, Butwal, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, Kakarvitta, Janakpur, Bhairahawa (Lumbini), Bharatpur (Chitwan),
etc. Local bus services provide transportation inside the city and into its vicinity. Night buses from Birgunj to Kathmandu
are the most luxurious bus services in all over Nepal. Birgunj bus park is the centre to find buses for any route,

Tanga
Horse driven carts locally called Tanga have historically been the mode of transport for the Madheshi people. Today it
survives as a popular transportation vehicle between Birgunj and its sister city Raxaul.

Cargo
The 6 km (3.7 mi) railway track from Raxaul to Birgunj was converted to broad gauge two years after the Indian railways
converted the track to Raxaul inside India to broad gauge. Now, broad gauge railway line connects Raxaul to the Sirsiya
(Birgunj) Inland Container Depot (ICD) that became fully operational in 2005. Talks have been held to reopen the railway
route from Birgunj to Amlekhganj in Nepal by converting it to broad gauge because of its socio-economic importance.
Goods are transported to and from India via Birgunj dry port, which is the key terminal of surface cargo delivery to Nepal.
This cargo point on the south connects the heart of the country, Kathmandu, via another key industrial city, Hetauda. It is
also served by Tribhuvan Highway, extending from the Indian border at Raxaul through Birgunj and Hetauda to
Kathmandu with frequent bus service. Simara Airport — 9 mi (14 km) north near the highway in Pipara Simara, Bara
district—offers scheduled flights to Kathmandu.
India and Nepal have an open border with no restrictions on the movement of their citizens. There is a customs checkpoint
for the movement of goods between the two countries.

Sports
The city has its own stadium, Narayani Stadium which is Nepal's second largest
stadium after Dasarath Rangasala built on 1981. The stadium has capacity of
15,000 seats.Its the home ground of Birgunj United FC.The team plays in Nepal
Super League,top tier football league.
A national level Cricket Ground is also located beside the Narayani Stadium. The
cricket ground has top class outfield and a better cricket pitch. National level and
Narayani Rangasala
Regional level cricket tournament are regularly held here. Every year day night T20
Cricket tournament is held using temporary flood light towers. Day night cricket
match in Nepal was first played here. Nepal national cricket team's players Haseem
Ansari, Aarif Sheikh, Avinash Karn and Irshad Ahmed hail from Birgunj. Cricket is the most popular sport and is played
more than any other games and sports.

At present,the stadium is in poor condition.
